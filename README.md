### BIOGRAPHY
I hold a Bachelor's Degree in Philosophy and I'm now a full-stack developer. This is just the beginning - my next step is to master Machine Learning. Why? With my humanistic background, I believe this historic moment in AI development is transformative. AI will reshape every aspect of society: work, politics, and culture. This is our chance to shape the future responsibly. My goal is to specialize in AI Ethics.

### CODE
I mainly write private code for corporations, but I hope to have time to code my personal projects and contribute to open source. It's hard with the speed of modern society and my daily commitments. Every day, I spend my free time studying recent philosophical books and ML news, but I try to dedicate as much time as possible to my passions and to the people I care about most. Life is too short, and I don't think it makes sense to dedicate all my time to work. There are more important things than work, like health, physical and psychological well-being, family, and friends.

-------------------------------------------

I'm not caught in the rat race :)

### SHORT-TERM PROJECTS
- Publish my personal website where I will write my reflections (in English, of course) and research.
- Write my first book and publish it.
- Set aside some daily time for my personal coding projects and help other developers with their open source projects.

I hope to network with interesting people to change this world together :)
